## Skills Demonstrated

This project demonstrates a broad and practical set of **data engineering and analytics skills**, applied across the full lifecycle of a modern SQL-based data warehouse.

---

### 1. Advanced SQL Programming

- **Window Functions**  
  Applied `ROW_NUMBER()` for deterministic deduplication and `LEAD()` to reconstruct valid historical timelines by resolving overlapping date ranges.

- **Stored Procedures**  
  Encapsulated ETL logic within reusable stored procedures (`CREATE PROCEDURE`), enabling controlled execution flow, parameterisation, and repeatable loads.

- **Complex Transformations**  
  Implemented `CASE WHEN` logic for data standardisation (e.g. mapping coded values such as `M/F` to `Male/Female`) and derived column creation.

- **Data Aggregation & Joins**  
  Integrated disparate CRM and ERP datasets using `LEFT JOIN` logic, alongside `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` clauses for duplicate detection and validation.

---

### 2. ETL Pipeline Design & Architecture

- **Medallion Architecture**  
  Designed and implemented a three-layer architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold) to clearly separate raw ingestion, data cleansing, and business logic.

- **Error Handling & Monitoring**  
  Built resilient pipelines using `TRY...CATCH` blocks to handle runtime failures gracefully, supported by custom logging to track execution duration and row counts.

- **Data Ingestion**  
  Managed high-volume CSV ingestion using `BULK INSERT` to optimise load performance and scalability.

---

### 3. Data Modelling & Warehousing

- **Star Schema Design**  
  Structured the Gold layer into Fact and Dimension models to support efficient analytical queries and reporting use cases.

- **Surrogate Keys**  
  Generated system-controlled surrogate keys using window functions to decouple the warehouse from source-system constraints and maintain referential integrity.

- **Data Quality Assurance**  
  Implemented validation checks covering primary key consistency, referential integrity, date validity, and core business rules (e.g. `Sales = Quantity × Price`).

---

### 4. Documentation & Best Practices

- **Naming Conventions**  
  Enforced consistent `snake_case` naming across schemas, tables, views, columns, and procedures to improve readability and maintainability.

- **Data Lineage**  
  Produced visual diagrams tracing data flow from raw source files through transformation layers to final reporting views.

- **Data Dictionary**  
  Created a structured data catalog detailing table schemas, column definitions, and applied business rules.
